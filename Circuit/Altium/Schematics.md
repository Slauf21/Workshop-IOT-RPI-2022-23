# Schematic

The PCB will be designed in Altium designer. In Altium create a new project and add a schematic to the project. The components will be put on this schematic. 
A lot of the sensors we read are external, meaning they are their own circuit boards and need to be connected with headers. The PCB will sit on the RPI headers. 
Here are the measurements of the pin headers:
